# Simulating-New-Keynesian-Model-with-Cost-Push-Shock-using-JuliaPerturbation-Toolbox
This work explores a New-Keynesian model in a closed economy, implemented in Julia with the JuliaPerturbation toolbox. It extends to include a cost-push shock by Peter N. Ireland. Simulated IRFs compare monetary policy, TFP, and cost-push shocks.
