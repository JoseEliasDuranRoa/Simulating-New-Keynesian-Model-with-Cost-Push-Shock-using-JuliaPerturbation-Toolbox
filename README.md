# Simulating-New-Keynesian-Model-with-Cost-Push-Shock-using-JuliaPerturbation-Toolbox
This work focuses on a medium-scale New-Keynesian model in a closed economy with com-
plete financial markets and capital accumulation, and its implementation in Julia using the
JuliaPerturbation toolbox created by Alvaro Salazar-Perez and Hernan D. Seoane (2023).
The model is extended by adding a cost-push shock, which is described in detail in a paper
by Peter N. Ireland (2002) . The impulse response functions (IRFs) are simulated for three
different types of shocks: a monetary policy shock, a TFP shock, and a cost-push shock.
The JuliaPerturbation toolbox is used to perform the perturbation and estimation of the
model, and finally the Impulse Response Functions are compared and discussed.
