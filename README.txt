In the zip folder you can find the following documents:

 1. solution_functions_7_0.jl: This file is from Salazar and Seoane Julia Toolbox, that is available in: https://github.com/HernanSeo/JuliaPerturbation
 
 2. Impulse Response Analysis.jl: In this file I solve the model, and plot the IRF for three different identification shocks 

 3. Determinancy Region Analysis.jl: In this file I study indeterminancy for α_y and α_ϕ for fixed intervals, iteratively solving the model and storing the values of the parameters that lead to a stable solution.

 4. Figures: A folder with the output of the previous code

 5. Writing Output: The final document in which the results and simulations are analysed in a research paper fashion. 

 ### NOTE!: To properly understand the exercise please read the Writing Output file ###
